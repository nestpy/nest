## Description

Nest (NestPy) is a framework for building efficient, scalable [Python](https://python.org/) server-side applications and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) (the default) and optionally can be configured to use [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) (in development) as well!

Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common Python frameworks (FastAPI/Flask), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.

## Philosophy

Nest provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications. The architecture is heavily inspired by NestJS and Angular.
